## Projects
### Music Generation with LSTM
[Code - repo](https://github.com/riyabasu06/Music-Generation-Using-LSTMs)

Project trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate new music sequences by learning temporal patterns in
MIDI files. The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI sequences, and after preprocessing, it captures the relationships between musical notes. The trained LSTM generates new music in MIDI format, which can be played or converted into audio.

### Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic for Cyber Security
[Code - repo](https://github.com/riyabasu06/-Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Traffic-for-Cybersecurity.git)

Focuses on detecting anomalies in network traffic to enhance cybersecurity using various machine learning models. It evaluates multiple models like XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression to identify the most effective approach for anomaly detection.
